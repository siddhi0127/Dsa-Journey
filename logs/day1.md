# 📅 Day 1 – Foundation & Logic Building

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Basics of problem solving
- Introduction to pseudocode
- Understanding flowcharts
- Revising basic programming concepts

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to think about a problem step by step before coding
- Writing pseudocode to represent logic clearly
- Using flowcharts to visualize program flow
- Importance of planning logic before implementation

## ✍️ Practice Work
- Created pseudocode for basic problems
- Designed flowcharts to understand control flow
- Focused on logic rather than syntax

## 💡 Experience
Day 1 helped me realize that coding is not just about writing syntax,
but about understanding the logic behind the problem.
Learning pseudocode and flowcharts made problem-solving easier and clearer.
